# Image Generation for E-commerce
# Project Overview
This project utilizes a generative AI model to create high-quality product images for e-commerce platforms. It includes features for product image augmentation and virtual try-on experiences using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
# Features
* Product Image Augmentation: Enhance product listings with diverse high-resolution images.
* Virtual Try-On: Allow customers to visualize products in real-time, enhancing purchase confidence.
# Dependencies
* Python 3.x
* PyTorch,Flask,Numpy,TorchVision
# Usage
* Train the GAN model using provided datasets.
* Run the Flask application: python app.py
* Access the application at http://localhost:5000.
# Folder Structure
* static/: images
* templates/: HTML templates
* app.py: Flask app for serving the model
* model.py: GAN architecture definition and image generation functions
